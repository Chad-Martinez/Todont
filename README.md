# Why to not do it?

Often our minds are running on auto-pilot. Sometimes we don't become aware of doing something until after we have done it. Sometimes the result of doing that thing had an unwanted outcome. We tell ourselves that we aren't going to do that again, but then we do it again, and again, and again. The first step in breaking the chain of a bad habit is to become aware that it is happening.

Enter the Todon't app. The app that helps you remember the things you don't want to do.

So go on, give it a try...or don't.


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
